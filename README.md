#This repository starts from tutorial 14. This is the moment I decided to put the code into GitHub so you don't have to watch the whole video and can figure it out yourself then check if you where right.

#Please do not claim that any of this code is your own, if you do plan on using it in any video, please credit the author (copy + paste):
